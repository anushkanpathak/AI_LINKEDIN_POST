00:00:00
 
Mentor : just give me one second. Okay, great. So what we'll do now uh uh we'll go through your resume and uh I will try to understand your work from you and then we'll try to improve it. So what you do uh just just share your resume uh and and uh on on the screen and then we'll start discussing one by one all the points.
Mentee's Presentation: Just one second.
Mentor : Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: Is my screen visible?
Mentor : Yeah, it is.
Mentee's Presentation: Yes.
Mentor : It is. Yeah. Great. Great. So, uh before we start, uh just just uh briefly tell me about your work and yourself. Just run me through your resume for a couple of minutes.
Mentee's Presentation: So uh basically uh I'm an electrical electronics engineer by training uh and I uh until recently my last job was with the British government. I was part of the British civil services and I used to I was serving as a senior trade adviser to the British high commissioner to India.
 
 
00:01:28
 
Mentee's Presentation: Uh prior
Mentor : Dang
Mentee's Presentation: to
Mentor : it.
Mentee's Presentation: that I have worked uh mostly in a project management product management role a little bit here and there and that was with a ship building firm and I have also worked with an NGO in the past in a program management role and my earliest role if I go back was with Deoid consulting this is around 10 years back in 2015 uh where I used to work with SAP uh ERP and primarily was a coding driven job so that that's the entire sort of elevated pitch my CV.
Mentor : Great. So, u your latest role was in British High Commission, Department of Business and Trade, right?
Mentee's Presentation: Yes.
Mentor : Government
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : of UK. So, what was your role here? What exactly was expected from you in this role?
Mentee's Presentation: So uh so the British High Commission is basically the posting uh where I was posted. Uh but the entity that I was part of was Department of Business and Trade.
 
 
00:02:24
 
Mentee's Presentation: So this is the counterpart for Ministry of Commerce in India. And uh my role primarily focused on three aspect. The first part was negotiation. So negotiation of the free trade agreement between UK and India. So I used to head the negotiation for the professional services chapter that includes accountancy, legal services, consulting and ESG related services. Uh the second part was consulting. So just like there are in-house consulting teams, uh there is for example EIL, Engineers India Limited. Uh similarly this is uh this is an advisory role where you advise both UK companies that are planning to come to India and Indian companies that are planning to go to UK and and uh at that level of consulting it is a it was always apex CXO level consulting. So so that was I think the USP of this role that any company you pick up in the list will always be a CEO client. Uh and the third aspect which I used to do was a little bit it was a mix of policy and advocacy.
 
 
00:03:17
 
Mentee's Presentation: So uh that's where you
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: are setting the agenda for UK and India. you're doing certain events, you're bringing trade missions from the UK to India. So these were the three major things. Anything related to any legal dispute, anything related to professional services, for example, if India puts up a tariff or does something, it would be my desk which was responsible and I used to lead the team. So I I was the nodal officer for this specific uh professional services role and I used to report to the first secretary who was like who used to look at broader trade in India.
Mentor : Sure. And so so how many team members what's the department structure here is so let's say there's a secretary right you Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. So the first secretary uh is basically someone who comes in from the UK. Uh he will be UK civil servant and
Mentor : Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: uh so be used to multiple chapters used to report to him or her.
 
 
00:04:06
 
Mentee's Presentation: Uh so for example professional services, financial services, various other sector, retail, creative, sports would report and feed into that that person's portfolio. Uh so for me my professional services sector we had around three more people uh I had three people you can say dotted line of reporting because of course the ultimate control was with the finance for the secretary but how to do it across India I used to look after that so that was the architecture but it's a lean organization because embassies as you know are very lean by the
Mentor : Mhm.
Mentee's Presentation: very nature
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: so yeah
Mentor : Yeah. And generally what is the how do you get recruited to this uh particular department?
Mentee's Presentation: so uh it's a competitive exam uh so one of the things which I have done in the past that had appeared for the Indian civil services exam and I had been shortlisted for the interview twice uh with the option of sociology. So you will often find a lot of people who have made it to the interview in the Indian civil services they you'll often find them working with this kind of place be it in the US trade service or recently we shut we you must have heard that they shut down US aid so these kind of entities you'll often find so my way was that advertisement had come in I applied it's a multi- sort of there are
 
 
00:05:11
 
Mentee's Presentation: multiple steps and know you have to clear I think around we had around 12 rounds of interview and written exam and then you get into the This
Mentor : Okay. Okay. Great. So, and you worked there for 2 years approximately.
Mentee's Presentation: almost one in one year 1 1.5 less than 1.5 but it's coming as 2325. Yeah.
Mentor : Sure. Sure. Okay. Cool. So, now let me go through your points. Let's go through
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : your point. So first uh here you section head in BCS over professional services align to directed advisory services stakeholder engagement plan for 30 plus FTPS chapters contributed to 50% Y trade also spread G2G negotiation uh profession
Mentee's Presentation: Heat.
Mentor : Oh, I did consider this concept and executed. So the first point right
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : what you know what was the reason that you were given this role right youngest section head
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : okay and what is the implication of that right is is
 
 
00:06:49
 
Mentee's Presentation: All right.
Mentor : not clear to me so how And what? Just tell me more about this point.
Mentee's Presentation: So what was the reason in the sense that that that position senior trade advisor so each trade stream will have a senior officer and the average age if you see will be anywhere because people retire from these posts usually know once you get in it's a permanent role as well it's a government job it's a permanent role so uh in my case I cleared the exam I got in to be very honest and because my port portfolio if you see my profile professional journey it is very mixed it has a mix of consulting. So this role has a lot of uh most of the exporters from UK in this sector are the consultants KPMG, Deoid, PWC, Grand Tharton. So that was the main reason that I was selected for this role because if you see my journey was from Deoid consulting it began there and I had experience of working with the government at at an NGO level had handled products uh as a at a startup and had also worked with island ship repairers where I was actually deputed with the government.
 
 
00:07:49
 
Mentee's Presentation: So there is GRSC in Kolkata, garden reached. So I was working with them and the Indian Coast Guard were my client. So they like the fact that I have consulting experience and civil services background is a definite like if you're prepared for it and have been to the interview that's a very major pull for them that they they think that the person understands Indian legal system and so on. So that was the reason. uh the youngest aspect even I don't know why did they select me honestly but but yeah I was the youngest person
Mentor : So
Mentee's Presentation: uh
Mentor : they
Mentee's Presentation: they had
Mentor : selected
Mentee's Presentation: ever
Mentor : you directly for this uh designation. Senior
Mentee's Presentation: yes yes
Mentor : generally what designation and what role they take it for.
Mentee's Presentation: so uh generally they go for EO so there are gradations based on just like India's pay scale they have EO executive officer HO is higher executive officer and then they have G7 SEOs and so on uh so mine was a higher executive officer That was the pay grade.
 
 
00:08:39
 
Mentee's Presentation: So usually you enter at an EO level. You EO A3 level and if you have just fresher you'll just come at an A3 level. You spend around 10 years uh at at an H EO level and then you are promoted to
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: HO level.
Mentor : Another question is when you say
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : oversaw is there any linkage linkage between um is there any linkage between being giving this I mean from first and second uh line for a part part of sentence mean being a youngest guy you were given uh professional services or these are independent
Mentee's Presentation: actually uh that sector is professional services. So
Mentor : I
Mentee's Presentation: uh
Mentor : question
Mentee's Presentation: uh
Mentor : is is there any reason that they given you professional services because of your profile or it was uh like
Mentee's Presentation: oh
Mentor : a
Mentee's Presentation: yeah yeah yeah exactly because of my profile. So the recruitment DBT does uh department of business and trade does they do not have a like like in India you have UPSC and they recruit all services together.
 
 
00:09:36
 
Mentee's Presentation: So the application was only for professional services. So for example we had professional services there was a separate application recruitment right for food and beverages. So if you clear the exam you automatically will be holding charge for this position. Uh so you can say that they chose me as the youngest officer and they also allocated this portfolio. They could have chosen to sort of give me a smaller portfolio. So but I I don't know how to ex establish that causal linkage
Mentor : thing is that's a good point you made 11.5 billion uh euro uh just saying
Mentee's Presentation: pounds.
Mentor : pound
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : yeah 11.5 so what are the size which is the biggest uh trade flow Please.
Mentee's Presentation: Uh the biggest trade flow size between UK and India is OBS. It's called other business services. So professional services it's a proxy for professional services. So and over there if you look at if you break it down further India is the major exporter right all this TCS and infosyses they export a lot of uh services from here from that side you have the likes of ERM and little bit of deoid because they are all headquartered in London so they are London registered so that's the reason so 11.5 is both trade export and import from UK to India because we used to
 
 
00:10:45
 
Mentee's Presentation: facilitate that and uh I have I thought about putting this number because it's a pretty big number but because I used to head the sector ultimately any file which would be related to this would come to me only so that's the reason I put it
Mentor : Okay. So, you write something like that. But youngest um youngest
Mentee's Presentation: oh yeah
Mentor : or or you write um
Mentee's Presentation: I thought this was a spike I never have written this ever
Mentor : Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: this
Mentor : No,
Mentee's Presentation: youngest
Mentor : no,
Mentee's Presentation: thing
Mentor : that is a good point. You say selected as youngest sector head in BHC 17 years history for for for the reason that reason we need to write. Okay. for for having for having for for my profile strength for my precise strength for this actually for my profile strength semicolon. Now oversaw is not a correct word. We
Mentee's Presentation: H.
Mentor : should try something else. Uh uh you can say managed or led.
 
 
00:12:02
 
Mentor : Managed or led. Led because you might be the senior most person there amongst
Mentee's Presentation: H.
Mentor : I mean after the secretary
Mentee's Presentation: No.
Mentor : also say led professional service vertical um something like this. After that something like this highest trade flow of 11.5 billion pound. Now highest second highest most important most critical that
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : adjective we can we can you can decide depend basis your data okay
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Right.
Mentor : right so what I'm trying to say is key why you have chosen forest this thing and there is a linkage between uh giving this portfolio
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : and what is the importance of this portfolio
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : okay that you should write
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : okay so that is the first Okay. Um, got it right. This one.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : Okay. Now, now what you need to do is see now what you've done is you've started writing your activities.
 
 
00:13:08
 
Mentor : Uh, directed advisory services, stakeholder management plans and policy advocacy road map for UK government advisory services, cross functional team negotiating. Okay. Can you tell me if you have to divide your work in three to four buckets what would be those
Mentee's Presentation: um uh so the first part would be negotiations. So that would be all sorts of negotiation with the government. uh this foremost was a free trade agreement which was recently concluded. Uh the second part was uh advocacy. So advocacy would involve engaging with so this so if trade negotiation is the most apex level of bilateral engagement that is done. Uh advocacy happens at G2G level or G2B level. So we can be very much working with on behalf of let's say uh a real example would be Clifford Chance is a very big UK law firm and they want to get into a tie-up with India. So we make that facilitate those meetings. We make sure they find the right partner. We advise them on who they should sort of work.
 
 
00:14:08
 
Mentee's Presentation: Should they go with Sri Lan Mangalas or another law firm. So that that's that's advocacy at part one part advocacy and advisory services on that front. And uh the third part is uh sort of related is doing events and all right so such events as if there will be a trade mission that is coming from UK to India. So I would be uh that I would be taking care of that from end to end from recruitment of the people who will be coming in that mission to who they will meet and what will be the overall agenda. What's the strategic objective that UK is trying to drive and these firms want to drive for example if there's a closed sector where
Mentor : What?
Mentee's Presentation: there is no trade happening for example legal services in India you cannot have foreign lawyers work in India so it's a completely closed sector which has not been prioritized. So we try to sort of get them in through round tables have discussion put them in colleges and all so that they can know build those linkages for recruitment and so on.
 
 
00:14:57
 
Mentee's Presentation: So so that in three buckets just to summarize again negotiation advocacy and advisory and uh events.
Mentor : Huh? So that should be your second point. So
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : before you so for a for a for any person right once first you tell you'll tell these all things I used to do major things and then might drill down okay you start by saying that managed or handled or or or uh performed or led trade negotiations
Mentee's Presentation: H.
Mentor : uh Policy advocacy G2G stroke G2B advisory entry market entry advisory country entry
Mentee's Presentation: Yes. Yes. Market entry trade and uh
Mentor : yeah
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : that you can write market entry advisory or whatever trade trade advisory
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : and strategic events and now one goal in order to ensure or to ensuring ensuring something one goal of that what could be that.
Mentee's Presentation: uh increasing uh uh trade flow between the two countries and we can put a number there actually.
Mentor : Yeah.
 
 
00:16:18
 
Mentee's Presentation: Okay, this much
Mentor : Yeah. Yes. Uh increasing the trade flow. Uh maybe what you can do from last year to this year how much it increased maybe
Mentee's Presentation: right.
Mentor : because of your effort right to some extent you can write that. Okay. helping helping increase trade trade interaction of whatever that by by this much or by
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : this much percentage. Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : Yeah. So that will be your overarching point which is broadly covering all of what you used to do and it is also bringing all those keywords at one place.
Mentee's Presentation: All right.
Mentor : Okay. So that is a second point. Now let's go to third point. Directed advisory services stakeholder management plan and policy advocacy road. You can go 30%. What do you mean by accounts? Accounts.
Mentee's Presentation: So accounts in the sense that uh so this this was a little bit unique in in uh at that role.
 
 
00:17:15
 
Mentee's Presentation: So uh just like sales have accounts professional services will have some big ticket exporters from the UK right for example Grand Tharton is a major exporter they do a lot of exports from there uh deoids PWC. So whenever their CEOs would come over, we would have to brief our high commissioner. So another example would be the economist magazine, right? So they have their own consulting arm called the economist impact and the economist intelligence unit. So we used to provide advisory to them and so these are accounts for us. So they when they reach out to us sorry
Mentor : Go ahead. Go ahead.
Mentee's Presentation: uh yeah so whenever they reach out to us for any advice for example foster and partners so some of the advice would be political in nature that foster and partners is an architectural firm also a professional services firm. they ran into some issue with uh let's say a state government or something right of of a certain place so they'll reach out to us that how do we approach it so we don't give them strategy advice which is often very common in B school we give them more in the political stuff that you shouldn't file a court case you shouldn't be going there or something like that
 
 
00:18:12
 
Mentor : got it. Okay. See, uh uh just one more question. This LNT is Indian company. So, you're talking
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : about both the sides, right? Those
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So for example, L&T there is a company called Achilles. Achilles is into supply chain optimization and it's a UK headquartered firm. So they have a UK presence. So we would also provide that kind of support. So Colgate Pomolive again is not an Indian company right but we had a bunch of ESG consultants that really wanted to work with them because Colgate is leading the charge on that uh Invest India ICIA government stakeholders. So the list is pretty long on that front because you can pretty much map certain UK firms which want to engage with specific Indian firms. Uh so it was in that space uh architectural firms would really wanted to engage with L&T.
 
 
00:19:04
 
Mentee's Presentation: So I went to their Mumbai headquarters and you meet the corporate directors
Mentor : Okay,
Mentee's Presentation: and we increase them up
Mentor : there are two things you need to do. Okay,
Mentee's Presentation: h
Mentor : first thing is uh a broad point which you are writing will will write a bit more better but something like that but we need to also write one line in which the nature of advisory like you said right uh you know entry to India or merger
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : merger
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : with company
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : whatever that is from the business perspective that is more useful in
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : your resume okay Uh for example, uh give me a couple of examples of best your best assignments in this advisory services.
Mentee's Presentation: Uh I think the best advisory service I did was uh helping the economist uh magazine launched their economist intelligence corporate network. So uh it's a sort of a think tank and it's a network they created of all I think around 30 uh HNI in India which included CEOs of Col Pam, Microsoft, Apple and so I helped them launch it in India.
 
 
00:20:10
 
Mentee's Presentation: I helped them not just launch it in India I provided them with the residents of the British high commission in India to launch it got the deputy high commissioner and it was a widely sort of well covered media covered event in that sense. So that was unwise in the sense that I helped them find out who should they reach out to who should be their clients what are the companies that will be more interested in it because we when you are in commercial diplomacy you sort of know who is interested into this kind of talk shop and who want to do thought leadership or something like that. So help them realize that okay there is an opportunity in India to do this. They had not launched in India. uh told them who they should recruit uh where they should hold host the event uh who they should have as the chief guest which was the deputy high commissioner who we briefed of course and and I briefed her on what can be done and so on.
 
 
00:20:54
 
Mentee's Presentation: So that was I think the flagship uh
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: high impact thing I did
Mentor : Very good. Another any other. So I want a couple of examples. The one is this. What can be second?
Mentee's Presentation: uh one would be that so another one uh would be on the legal services side so to speak. So uh legal services is a closed market. So we advised on UK law firms on how they can operate in India, right? So there is a little bit of uh you know just like BO service there's LPO legal process outsourcing is quite quite common right now. So we got a bunch of companies there is a company called Baker McKenzie and there's another one called Clifford Chance. Clifford Chance is UK's biggest law firm. So
Mentor : Mhm.
Mentee's Presentation: we helped them get up in a tie get into a tie up with an Indian firm on LPO related work. uh there was another company Cameroon Navaro and bar again a UK company that we helped them sort of get into something called a handshake agreement with an Indian law firm.
 
 
00:21:45
 
Mentee's Presentation: So in legal services advising all these law firms under the ambit of their bar council just like we have bar council of India we had bar council of England and Wales. So I my clients there was bar council of England and Wales directly working with them we helped them identify sort of map which UK corporations can work best with India. uh help them identify the trade flows that it's because law is very diverse like should you do real estate? Real estate is very indigenous. So finding the right kind of crossber advisory is one area. One of my clients Herbert Smith Freeh Hills is Airel's international sort of law adviser right now. So Herbert Smith freehills getting them to Airel was also something I did
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: in this role. Yeah.
Mentor : So how do you write a test is first point first. So so basically see uh you start with writing the impact first. So for example you
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
 
 
00:22:35
 
Mentor : start with you say deepened bilateral commercial ties
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : by directing advisory by by directing me by consulting uh engagement Consulting uh consulting uh okay uh so again deepen bilateral commercial ties by advisory by providing advisory services stakeholder management engagement plan and polity policy advocacy road maps to or or for UK government for 30k uh Indian accounts and then you can give the this thing uh the this thing you are just changing the flow.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : Now what you need to do once you do that subullet a you need to give specific examples for example
Mentee's Presentation: All right.
Mentor : you give for example you give uh the first one which is economist. Do you say uh something like that um
Mentee's Presentation: All right.
Mentor : created or helped economist enter India or helped economist in its Indian market entry strategy by by identifying the opportunity landscape or by identifying the opportunity yeah opportunity landscape comma what else we have done opportunity providing
Mentee's Presentation: the mapping. uh them to the right client, connecting them with the right clients uh to
 
 
00:24:28
 
Mentor : networking support and maybe which basically two to three things which help them to enter India and you did that
Mentee's Presentation: yeah
Mentor : right that is for Indian that is for uh this thing uh this economist one uh for legal services.
Mentee's Presentation: I think
Mentor : So,
Mentee's Presentation: Herbert Smith free hills I helped them land ALE as their client. So they didn't have AEL on their record. So uh we got that engagement directly from like sort of correcting them with the AEL CEO and know the high commission everyone advising them that this could be a big ticket account for Herbert Smith freehills because AEL has a massive presence in UKL. So that was something we we focused on quite a bit.
Mentor : so uh do you have any contract value or something or revenue value for AEL I mean from AL
Mentee's Presentation: I
Mentor : for this company.
Mentee's Presentation: I think that will be I think I don't think that is publicly available because that's the contract between these two but I can sort of get an estimated number or something
 
 
00:25:29
 
Mentor : Huh?
Mentee's Presentation: like that
Mentor : No, maybe do one thing before that just search in their website.
Mentee's Presentation: right
Mentor : Maybe they would have mentioned like if this is a positive
Mentee's Presentation: yeah yeah
Mentor : if that is then that is otherwise you say ensured high ticket uh engagement between and this company
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : bracket may UK's largest legal firm and then by doing XYZ whatever that XYZ you can say CXO level meetings CXO and high commissioner level meetings
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : and uh providing plan or whatever Right. So these two is is is is good direct impact.
Mentee's Presentation: All
Mentor : So first while the the main point is uh broad these are few things I used to do. These are the examples of what you did the impact which you created directly right
Mentee's Presentation: right.
Mentor : will be more understandable by anyone who is reading and it will be more interesting then
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : there's a story now
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : right
 
 
00:26:31
 
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : okay otherwise uh this point will become a bit bland people may not able to appreciate that that's why we are doing some uh specific impact we are bringing some specific impact Uh so far so good.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : Next is led cross functional team negotiating UK and India free trade in PS chapters contributing to 15% Y trade route also spearhead G2G negotiation see uh for for for for unlocking UK market access there are too many u information in this point
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : so first we need to make it more concise. You may want to split it because what I'm confused is what is the is there any relation between this 500 million and 15%.
Mentee's Presentation: Right. No. Uh I think just a second. The 500 million would be in the previous point. The consulting one is the next point. Uh so consulting one you're talking about the provided consult consultancy service to CXO level clients
Mentor : No,
Mentee's Presentation: which is for the 50 million
 
 
00:27:48
 
Mentor : no,
Mentee's Presentation: that
Mentor : not
Mentee's Presentation: one right
Mentor : that one. The
Mentee's Presentation: you
Mentor : third
Mentee's Presentation: mean the 15%. Oh, that. Yeah. Yeah. They're different points completely
Mentor : Uh-huh. So you just uh first of all so let's not mix it first point
Mentee's Presentation: yeah
Mentor : and otherwise uh it might get confused. Now
Mentee's Presentation: right.
Mentor : you don't want to start with let cross functional team it's very general everyone does it. to start with increased or contributed in uh in the growth of contributed uh to 15% Y trade growth by by uh what is the main reason because of which this trade growth Thanks.
Mentee's Presentation: So uh there were barriers trade barriers. So we had a couple of uh technical barriers to trade that was causing some bottlenecks between UK and India. So during the course of negotiation itself we managed to sort of dehyenate it from the wider trade agreement and uh even after I left the same chapters I worked on were realized and they put it in the free trade agreement.
 
 
00:28:48
 
Mentee's Presentation: They signed it just two three months back. So even for the agreement everything was done we had done a quantitative study which is publicly available on the internet is widely avail 15 15% year on year uh y trade growth so that was the reason that I put this number there especially
Mentor : No, I got that my my
Mentee's Presentation: yeah
Mentor : question is so if I have to say that 15% growth happened here will happen because of XYZ reasons.
Mentee's Presentation: oh so yeah that would be uh softening of certain technical barriers to trade right so that was one thing that we did the second thing that we did was making it easier for skilled laborers to move from India to the UK and vice versa so that's a major relaxation specifically because professional services is by and large related to visa issues no because it's mostly people driven so that is one another bottleneck that we managed to sort of sort and clear it out okay this will be easier uh and third aspect that we did was we we worked on the taxation part between UK Okay.
 
 
00:29:48
 
Mentee's Presentation: In India because services are much more difficult to tax. Uh we didn't used to have it in writing earlier. So
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: that was the reason.
Mentor : Something like that you write uh
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : increase 15% Y trade growth by Okay. uh by uh by addressing or by negotiating trade barriers colon or such colon then you write uh uh removing technical barriers uh skill labor mobility or whatever you call it skilled
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : professional mobility and taxation
Mentee's Presentation: Aster.
Mentor : ah taxation during UK India free trade agreement uh negotiations PS chapters negotiations
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : or during in sector right in UK India uh free trade agreement PS chapter negotiations
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : That is one point that cross functional team you can see somewhere else you can put this
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : is okay or you can put here also you can say semicolon and you can put here also okay I said give me five minutes I am getting a call which a bit urgent
 
 
00:31:18
 
Mentee's Presentation: No
Mentor : I'll call
Mentee's Presentation: worries.
Mentor : I just weight
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. No problem.
Mentor : just I you have to maybe five minutes I'll take because this is from one of the uh you know IM's professor

Mentor : Yeah. Hello, Mayor. You're there.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : I'm sorry. And he wanted to talk something.
Mentee's Presentation: No, no problem. No problem. I understand.
Mentor : He's very hard to find.
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Uh
Mentor : Cool. So, let's get to that point. Huh. So, what
Mentee's Presentation: yeah.
Mentor : I was saying is 15%
 
 
00:47:21
 
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : and mobility.
Mentee's Presentation: Right. Right. Uh
Mentor : mobility
Mentee's Presentation: hello.
Mentor : in
Mentee's Presentation: Uh
Mentor : in UK
Mentee's Presentation: uh labor
Mentor : India
Mentee's Presentation: mobility. Yeah.
Mentor : UK India free trade agreement PS chapters negotiation
Mentee's Presentation: Yes. Uh
Mentor : that
Mentee's Presentation: uh
Mentor : is first point
Mentee's Presentation: right.
Mentor : now second point will be this that spare D2G negotiation government to government negotiation for unlocking just just tell me one thing just to understand it uh assuming 500 ys assuming 500 y% will be
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : approximately uh let's say 1.5 billion uh
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : approximately right 11.5%.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : I'm taking that number as a reference to
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : 500 million right 500 million is part of that increase correct.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah, but yeah as I said these are two different points. So basically 500 millions are a bottleneck that existed but there were certain existing bottlenecks.
 
 
00:48:34
 
Mentee's Presentation: So market access barriers were independent of FDA. So FDA you negotiating at a broader level strategic level. So give and take India agriculture sector is closed right UK closed right. So that kind of you do I'll open something you remove your tariff line but market access barriers these are existing legal you can say disputes you can say it's a difference in terms of TCS that kind of stuff is this existing I was working on it 500 million accounts that that engagement I was leading on so uh one example is AIU association of Indian universities ities. So they do a lot of trading with ICA IC AW which is India charted accounted what is OSKA counterpart. So that I was leading uh for that.
Mentor : got it. So this unlock this should be a like separate point writing
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : like and you should start with that only that unlock UK's market access barriers worth this much for the PS sector by spearheading G2G negotiations
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
 
 
00:49:46
 
Mentor : you start with the uh so one so two points basically it should be separate point and it should start with the uh impact
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : right okay good till here it's okay right
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah.
Mentor : yeah next is provided consultancy soluted CX level client from firms operating and you can okay this is kind of similar thing right same thing
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : I mean what I'm asking is is this similar to what you have written in the second point I mean this director directed advisory services this point
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Uh so the difference being between two of them must be that was the Indian accounts and these are the UK accounts. So generally what happens when you are in commercial diplomacy your contracts or your stakeholders will be on both sides. That's how you match them right. So In a way you can say I made that similar point into two points. Yeah, you have to advise someone from the UK to find them the right guys in India.
 
 
00:50:53
 
Mentee's Presentation: But at the same time people for example Hindustan Uni Liver is a UK company because Uni Liver is UK company. So you can argue okay Hindustan Uni Liver was looking for someone to do ESG consulting for them. They reached out because these guys meet the high commissioner event. So that's that's the way it comes to us. So that's the reason I put it as a separate account. But who is the priority account for us working at the embassy? It would be this this these British accounts. This is the economist group. Yeah. Baker Mckenzie, Baker Tilly, Grant Thornton. So these are all UK firms. Previous one was all Indian firms. So
Mentor : Okay. So
Mentee's Presentation: so
Mentor : this XO level clients are Indian, right?
Mentee's Presentation: uh CXO level clients at both side UK and Indian.
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: So
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: sidesh
 
 
00:51:40
 
Mentor : Okay. Okay. Corridor enabling 50 million and is may is there any so two we have already written right legal and economist is there any extra thing you have done here any other type of consulting you have
Mentee's Presentation: Bakery network. Bakery network is network of chartered accountants basically professional services body. So I held uh an Indian company called ASA which is I think fifth or sixth seventh largest um professional services company in India to get become a part of the Baker TD network which is a London headquartered network with a lot of partners. I think it's the biggest professional network after the big four.
Mentor : So what does it mean? Like
Mentee's Presentation: So
Mentor : when
Mentee's Presentation: these are all limited liability partnerships right. So network model is very common in accountancy
Mentor : Yes.
Mentee's Presentation: network. So I will transport my business to you if you're in that network.
Mentor : Ah correct.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : So
 
 
00:52:43
 
Mentee's Presentation: So
Mentor : this
Mentee's Presentation: work. Yeah.
Mentor : is in Indian network.
Mentee's Presentation: Yes. Yes. So now if you go to ringden and all they will actually they call themselves as bakery. It used to be just uh ASA until part.
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: So yes.
Mentor : So there are two things. Okay. One is this that uh you can start with saying that enabled 50 million UK exports by doing XY these things. First point. Second point you can create uh which is that example right that uh enabled uh association of or a joint venture of or whatever you name it right uh what's that engagement and armare right what is the legal name of that legal or professional name of that engagement
Mentee's Presentation: Uh I I don't think merger I was just looking up on LinkedIn. So ASA has changed its name from ASA India to Baker ASA India. So you can say merger partnership I think partnership would be
 
 
00:53:44
 
Mentor : partnership
Mentee's Presentation: the right right word.
Mentor : partnership
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : and you can search also maybe they
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : would
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : have even more detail
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : of
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : engagement
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : but let's say for now let's go with uh partnership so you say ensured partnership between Indian ASA network and British XYZ network makers uh network by doing something. Why? Doing what? By doing what?
Mentee's Presentation: By advising them, mapping the state pretty much advising them and helping them realize opportunity. We created the document to tell them what's the export opportunity because bakery we didn't want to actually merge with some uh
Mentor : Great. Yeah. Okay. So that is what uh you know that is what uh you need to write. Okay. Okay. Next is deployed GTM strategies non-market advisory and targeted stakeholder engagement across 20 plus. This is similar point right now.
 
 
00:54:52
 
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Similar points. So yeah, I was thinking of writing this for this this Baker Mckenzie thing only. Uh
Mentor : Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: but I should write it for the professional consultancy services for UK experts, right?
Mentor : Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: Maybe
Mentor : Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: I should um
Mentor : Yeah. Yeah. I don't mind it because in context you know right but
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : idea is that we bring out all these business term opportunity mapping market assessment improving the export you know providing consulting those things should come right
Mentee's Presentation: H
Mentor : so yeah so next is conceptualized and executed a high impact event road map yeah that's good to help us activation across India Yeah, you know stakeholders may attend this uh event road map.
Mentee's Presentation: UK India uh legal roundt driver I
Mentor : The
Mentee's Presentation: think
Mentor : last
Mentee's Presentation: India
Mentor : one
Mentee's Presentation: can
Mentor : conceptualized
 
 
00:55:57
 
Mentee's Presentation: sorry
Mentor : and exe this one conceptualized and executed a high impact event road map
Mentee's Presentation: uh
Mentor : righters Indian or global
Mentee's Presentation: to
Mentor : attend Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: road map basically 20K is one of the stakeholder. So that's what I meant by it. It's a high.
Mentor : Sure. And and when you say activation, right,
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : activation is basically your leads, right?
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. So in a sense leads basically these are events. So I was personally present in all of them.
Mentor : Mhm.
Mentee's Presentation: And every event you can easily assume these were all the stakeholders we got.
Mentor : Sure. Sure. Sure. Sure. No. This is good point actually. This is okay. So till now we have discussed this five six points right a couple of things we discussed one is youngest youngest director then we also added one broad point negotiation policy ad G2B advisory and strategic event that we discussed
 
 
00:57:29
 
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : then uh we we did this 30 key account point in which we added two examples
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : then we brought like you know break down these point to two there's 15 and 500 million
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : then consulting yeah consulting we added one point that Baker you know Baker Mckenzie point
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : that
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : association of ASA and Baker Mckenzie then
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : point we said it is kind of repetitive
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : so that's okay and the last point I said it's okay it looks
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : okay any
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : doubt in this in in this um kind of in this area any doubt
Mentee's Presentation: Hybrid CVB. So that I have not put because I think complex just say just if I put negotiation, sales, consultancy and this and that. So is that you would advise something I should go for that
Mentor : See,
Mentee's Presentation: or just
 
 
00:58:21
 
Mentor : see for now see if you if you see whatever we done is kind of we did in that structure only
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Uh
Mentor : then
Mentee's Presentation: right, right.
Mentor : we discuss in that flow only
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Okay.
Mentor : or for master resumeum you keep that in mind you can write it also there's no problem in that way anyways this you are not going to submit so
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : you you can always club these points uh respective to their negotiation heading their advisory heading and their uh this event heading okay that you can do when companies start coming for example a consulting company come you may want to write more about advisory or you
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : may want to bring some point from negotiation and put it in advisory because there will be
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : some which have both advisory B negotiation BA
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : like that right so for now you can do that structure you can give those three headings and under those three there will be two three two three two three points
 
 
00:59:19
 
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : you can do that this will be easy for you then to reshuffle them or know kiss point it will help you only
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : So you can do that. You can you can write it under these three headings. Uh
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : advisory and advocacy could be one. Trade neg could be another and event could be third.
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Okay.
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : Now next is uh
Mentee's Presentation: Uh so yeah this was a more core engineering role but it was mostly on the project management side. So section had uh in military defits what happens is that there are different sections that do different work ship building firm which exclusively work on building new ships. Some will be focusing on just repairs. Some will be just be more denting painting events and that kind of stuff. So it's military refits and refits are basically upgrade and overhaul. So I'm an electrical electronics engineer by training and I knew someone who I had met in my previous role who was very keen.
 
 
01:00:27
 
Mentee's Presentation: It was more of a project management role you can say. So there were four ships warships that I worked on all for Indian coast guard. So Indian coast guard account was given to me. I used to look after that account end to end entire project management what has to be installed right from the point tendering RFI all these meetings I attended. I would advise within my firm and then when I was the spoken officer from the Indian coast guard who used to head all the refits. So refits are basically four warships I did. Uh there was a team of around 60 plus a blend of blue collar and white collar employees although a lot of them were contract labor not not permanent staff. Uh and that I did
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: over there.
Mentor : How many months were you there?
Mentee's Presentation: I was there for exactly one year.
Mentor : Exactly
Mentee's Presentation: Just just
Mentor : one.
Mentee's Presentation: I think yeah just just five six days more than that
 
 
01:01:24
 
Mentor : Okay. That program management office for a 400. How many projects you have worked? One or more.
Mentee's Presentation: four projects four warships so four major warships and uh there were the major projects that I worked on
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: so rolling shelter it's a constant sort
Mentor : Got
Mentee's Presentation: of
Mentor : it.
Mentee's Presentation: roll out going on
Mentor : So got it. So four projects. So generally
Mentee's Presentation: Retreat will depend on the kind of refit you're doing.
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: Uh on average you can say 3 months 3 3.5 something like that.
Mentor : Yeah. Yeah. And months
Mentee's Presentation: uh 400 million basically 100 million is the value of the warship but because refit is pretty much you can say it goes up to as much as 10 million sometimes depends on the condition of the ship pan ships may right from the steel to everything and all that so you'll change that everything from the body engine
Mentor : And
Mentee's Presentation: everything is changed
 
 
01:02:27
 
Mentor : this ISR is a it takes some specific part of that refit or the entire refit. Taste
Mentee's Presentation: entire refit. So they work with GRSC garden reach and GRSC sometimes subcontracts it but portfolio ISR was doing it entirely on its own
Mentor : and for all all the four uh let's say projects right
Mentee's Presentation: H.
Mentor : if you have to tell your designation what would be
Mentee's Presentation: So section head is what they used to call me because the entire project management in ship building they would call that that person a section head. So entire section just repeat is a section for them would be handled by me independent staff there's no overlap
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: there's no agile thing there right
Mentor : Yeah. Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: uh
Mentor : Got it. So, so first point, right? Uh and another point is you have written program management office, right?
Mentee's Presentation: yeah
Mentor : So generally
Mentee's Presentation: yeah because I felt same question he has a section hack caches.
 
 
01:03:29
 
Mentee's Presentation: So it's I realize it's by and large program management because there are multiple projects running under you. Uh but there's no such thing as program management office because it's all very cut and dry hardware driven
Mentor : program management office is a totally different connotation.
Mentee's Presentation: right.
Mentor : what we need to write it is in project management only because see project management office is someone who sits at corporate center and takes uh uh kind of reports and monitoring of all the projects
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Okay.
Mentor : you were like a there are four projects one by one and you were there in the projects right
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was heading them. Yeah.
Mentor : first managed manage four projects uh with budget this much which accumulate budget of this much uh 200 400 million military refit portfolio um for clients from MOD MOA and
Mentee's Presentation: H.
Mentor : that is first point to manage projects worth this much four projects worth this much for military refit portfolio for for clients from these clients.
 
 
01:04:53
 
Mentor : Okay. Your first point. Second point then you say manage end to end project execution including and all those keywords scoping planning
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : execution reporting risk management
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : stakeholder management Right.
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : Yeah. So that will be your second point.
Mentee's Presentation: Hey
Mentor : management, resource management, resource management, reporting.
Mentee's Presentation: It's number right.
Mentor : This one
Mentee's Presentation: No
Mentor : is
Mentee's Presentation: number.
Mentor : actually it's a followup point of suspect
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : just
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : next point is so so far so good. Any doubt in this?
Mentee's Presentation: No. No. Let's go.
Mentor : Okay, cool. Next is reported directly to ICG uh riffit hit distinct reading end to end project life cycle management for four advanc oversaw across functional team of 60 employees and contractors reported directly to ICG. This thing you can put in the first point itself you can start with that
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
 
 
01:06:39
 
Mentor : reported directly to discuss this thing this thing by for managing
Mentee's Presentation: M.
Mentor : program then that's the entire line
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : that is first
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : second is uh second
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : less functional team of 60 plus employees and contractors
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : managing, planning, resource management and everything. Then
Mentee's Presentation: Right. Right.
Mentor : now this RFP should be a separate plan point
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Mhm.
Mentor : like now tell me one thing uh so RFP is not a project okay RP
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : before a project you are trying to win that RFP
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : you're
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : trying to win that so that is a totally different point
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : correct
Mentee's Presentation: True. True. True.
Mentor : first second or third point second point is about program.
 
 
01:07:39
 
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Uh I gave I think at least input because it's not a very big firm. Right. So I gave inputs or six RFPs. Uh and uh yeah at least my whole room I'll check once more because there were smaller boards as well. We used to do some consulting for BSF. So they have very small boats right they do a lot of patrolling in West Bengal and all I can check that and I can get back on that
Mentor : And what input you used to do on what part you used to give the uh inputs for
Mentee's Presentation: most of the time in would be usually around costing and resourcing resourcing because if you're going for an RFP we need to know our internal capabilities alone RFP they to respond to that would ultimately respond right so it wasn't you cannot say shaping technofunctional inputs I I didn't say directly I would write proposal
 
 
01:08:57
 
Mentor : That's okay. That's okay. That is okay.
Mentee's Presentation: yeah
Mentor : You slide
Mentee's Presentation: yeah
Mentor : something like that. Provided cost estimate inputs.
Mentee's Presentation: okay
Mentor : Basically ultimately what you're doing
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Great.
Mentor : that is their call like your management or your selling call but as an as a as a project manager you are giving project
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
Mentor : you say provided cost estimate and uh resource requirement inputs for six plus RFP. P or six RFPs for these clients some of the names of the clients right
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : now another point is driving partner coordination that is again a different point
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Okay.
Mentor : so see what I'm trying to say you write one point with one specific meaning output
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Okay.
Mentor : otherwise
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Uh right right
 
 
01:10:10
 
Mentor : Driving partner coordination.
Mentee's Presentation: basically ship warship especially for Indian naval warship exclude even if you look at indigenous stuff everything will be from different entities weapon system dynamics limited sensors you'll be using some other system will be providing the helicopter support landing system another contractor will be doing so rolls engine MT so all this partner coordination partner vendor gives us the product because these are not things which you have in spare all the time because each ship is different so when you win the tender you sort of have this long-standing uh relationship with these entities and you make sure all
Mentor : So
Mentee's Presentation: the
Mentor : material
Mentee's Presentation: products
Mentor : uh buying material is in your head your your responsibility right.
Mentee's Presentation: yeah buying subcontracting we have long-standing relationships with them everything is codified they have I think 10 years long relationship but raise once the management clear said the money has been given to them commitment the deal has been signed I would coordinate with them state and installation is also a problem because you we cannot install a Rolls-Royce engine right because of warranty reasons and everything so they will install it test it and do everything we'll test at the system level.
 
 
01:11:34
 
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: So that is a separate user testing aggregate level in in conjunction with these guys. So you can say in a way it's a subcontracting part. You subcontract a specific part to a specific entity.
Mentor : So you write that in the part of project management only. Second or third
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : point you
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : say coordinated with these many vendors or
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : suppliers or OEMs
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : including ROS MTU for for on-time delivery and installation of key equipments or whatever technologies whatever it is
Mentee's Presentation: Right. Okay.
Mentor : that's a part of your project management.
Mentee's Presentation: Right. Right.
Mentor : So you're getting my point right at this point
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : we have
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : totally dismantled it and used some like you know
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : we
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : fitted them in different respective locations.
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
 
 
01:12:30
 
Mentor : Okay. Any doubt in this point?
Mentee's Presentation: No, no,
Mentor : Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: it's good.
Mentor : Next is overhaul overhauled enable repeat processes to optimize turnability. Ah this is good actually. You start
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : with uh this you start with the uh result. See this is clear right? This is very clear
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : to me because
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : there's one kind of one message to me as a so you start with that and I mean you don't need to bold everything.
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : Yeah. You just say optimize turnaround time by 15% and reduced aggregate yard services cost by or aggregate cost I mean yeah that is also okay reduce cost by 18%. By
Mentee's Presentation: Great.
Mentor : overalling maybe you say redesigning or improving naval
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : processes
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : or engineering that could also be used but overhauling
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : is a bit I mean a
 
 
01:13:28
 
Mentee's Presentation: Wider.
Mentor : better
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : yeah
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : redesigning the process or improving the naval refit process.
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : Okay. Next is conducted stakeholder demo for six platforms. What is platform? Which platform?
Mentee's Presentation: So platforms generic use warships could be there. Uh we could have fast uh FPVS fast patrol vessels. So these are not really warships. So these are the speed boats you often see for interceptor operations. So ch platform even the platforms I didn't work on uh for refit I was there for the user testing and you have to take them out to ship dry so it takes around easily 6 to 8 days right keep take it out take it bring it back take it for longer sailing and all so stakeholder demo it's like you you have to bring someone from the client office they will be there they'll be making notes we'll be making notes they'll be auditing our notes and so
 
 
01:14:25
 
Mentor : This is basically kind of a demonstration of final result.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: You I think user testing to use a computer par right. Yeah.
Mentor : Cool. Let development of ISRs uh digital front end.
Mentee's Presentation: So this is a trivial point but uh they didn't have a website basically. So because everything sub tendering is like that it's all one of those old school road construction kind of work. So I let them create the website. I sort of nagged the leadership. You need to have a website. You need to have it. It's a pretty decent one of the eight firms that does work in India for naval refills side. So and even though they're a medium sort of sort of enterprise but yeah I don't know how relevant this is but
Mentor : That
Mentee's Presentation: yeah.
Mentor : is relevant actually it's good point you say initiated and
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : led initiated is a better word in this context because you only convince the top management initiated is a good leadership skill you say initiated and led just add word initiated and Yeah.
 
 
01:15:36
 
Mentor : And this is a good point. Okay. Okay. So, anything in ISR.
Mentee's Presentation: No, that's it. Looks good. So yeah,
Mentor : Now, next is MRN. MRS. Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: so this is a startup I worked in. Uh so prior to this I was in uh uh there's this uh NGO which was looking at uh animal husbandry primarily and one of my friends uh he wanted to start his own startup. This is still an operational startup. It's actually become profitable now. So it has broken even uh and it's based out of Jaipur. and uh he wanted to do e-commerce and sell pets basically
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: through internet or telephonic service. So he he was of the opinion and he's based out of Rajasthan. He felt that a lot of people especially small pets you will see hamsters and cheese not not everyone will be know this big ticket sales will not be there.
 
 
01:16:32
 
Mentee's Presentation: So this was he founded it. So I was the first guy who joined him as a product manager. Uh so that that is this is the wider background of the firm. So it's still a small firm. It's not a very massive firm but it's still operating. I think they have around 50 60 employees now right now.
Mentor : Okay. Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : And as a PM, what exactly was your role?
Mentee's Presentation: I think PM is basically because I did pretty much everything. So basically as a product road map let's what's the wider philosophy of Mr. and Mrs. Pet because initially we thought we'll sell pets then it became we will only the USP was we'll only sell ethically bred pets. So you're buying a dog whether the breeder has a kennel club of India certification or not. So up how many generations back you go into know the the pets pups parents and so on whether the pup has been kept in a good condition or not.
 
 
01:17:27
 
Mentee's Presentation: So that was the USP although we sold all sorts of pets this but this is where we focused on this is the niche. Uh so that was the product vision initial.
Mentor : Mr. and Mrs. an e-commerce for ethical pet care brand something like that.
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : See the most important information from this section would be you can bring lot of innovative keywords here.
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : So
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : and Mrs. Pet is a e-commerce company can we say
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Definitely.
Mentor : and its idea is ethical uh pet care brand right
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : ethical pet care
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : Mr. and Mrs. N you know an e-commerce
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : for e-commerce platform for ethical ethical pet care or ethical
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : pet
Mentee's Presentation: Right. Mhm. Mhm.
Mentor : that will add a lot of information by only adding these two three words
 
 
01:18:28
 
Mentee's Presentation: Right. Right. Right. Uh
Mentor : management product management
Mentee's Presentation: Here you go.

Mentee's Presentation: But this was the number I had last year. I just put that there.
Mentor : launched eight new product offerings contributes
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : 25% of 2021 revenue semicolon semicolon now you can write lot of product management keywords For example, um conceptualized and designed by market research, market and user research, comma created product road maps, comma created MVPs, led development and perform GTM of the products of these offics. Right? You getting my point? So
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : what end to end you have done to bring this offerings into into defined unique value propositions.
 
 
01:20:47
 
Mentor : So what you do maybe you read product management
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : formally informally
Mentee's Presentation: Right. Yeah, right.
Mentor : market
Mentee's Presentation: Right,

Mentee's Presentation: right,
Mentor : Got it.
Mentee's Presentation: right.
Mentor : Any doubt? Any question in this?
Mentee's Presentation: No, no, this looks good. Yeah.
Mentor : This is important point. Okay. Next is TK drove 150% sale regarded by strategically expanding into SQUs. Very good. Very good. This is a good point. Okay. This is good point. Cut operational cost. Reduce click cut. Reduce operational cost by this thing. Pro comprehensive internal workflow. H this is also good point. Hey, this is uh okay raise investment may this is good my point is invest in
Mentee's Presentation: Um, do Angel investors present. So, I'm just waiting for uh
 
 
01:22:25
 
Mentor : partnerspective partners
Mentee's Presentation: right right
Mentor : similarly
Mentee's Presentation: uh
Mentor : investment you should write 30 plus uh like along with
Mentee's Presentation: okay
Mentor : C 30 plus VCs and angel investors present right
Mentee's Presentation: right
Mentor : that will be a good point
Mentee's Presentation: yeah
Mentor : okay so that also you add other okay
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : great any doubt any question in
Mentee's Presentation: So just a more generic question usually star framework right but just some points where I have written the results first. So what is the usual like how do you prefer it like what's the better way to put it? Should we start with numbers? Start because all the numbers come at the end.
Mentor : See so so star is a framework in which we can write also RSC
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : also ASR also depending upon what is the most important thing in your case or in most of the cases when you're coming from diverse industries it is better that you start with result because everyone will uh associate result easily
 
 
01:23:36
 
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : like in like like this that improved uh introduced eight offerings.
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : Now introduce eight offerings is the most easily uh understandable and appreciable thing
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : right for the recruiters that's why I'm writing
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : result
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : in
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : some let's say
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : then I would maybe start
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Okay.
Mentor : so that also depends on when there is no context Most of the time we will use result first
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : only those time we will not use result first where I want to call out something which is very important like met pradan mantri
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : something like that you get my point right so so that kind of a thing so for now for example you've written drove 150% sales growth that is enough for me
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : cut uh cut or reduce operational cost by 85% that is enough for me right
 
 
01:24:52
 
Mentee's Presentation: All right.
Mentor : now in this my next is activity shared stage with CEO but that is good for me right
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : so that's why I'm writing like this okay because that
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : is also appreciable also and understandable also by any layman person or any third party
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : so
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : the structure should be RA sr ars that depends upon how do I want to showcase what I want to showcase okay
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : that might vary company to
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : Yeah.
Mentee's Presentation: Okay. Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : Okay. Next is Janet K.
Mentee's Presentation: This was a NGO. So,
Mentor : Next.
Mentee's Presentation: uh it's a Jan based NGO. It's it's pretty old. It operates out of Jarkan parts of Bihar and eastern uh west and west Bengal. Uh and it's mostly focused on tribal tribal people and especially women. So, I went there.
 
 
01:25:43
 
Mentee's Presentation: So, uh there is there was a role in animal husbandry. So there was a lot of government scheme called Rashtri Gokul missionabala uh and Jarkan government there was also a UN funded mission where they were providing free basically free it was it was a basically a package of free uh cattle coupled with subsidized loan coupled with government freedom logistics we'll provide you to you for free and no onboarding charges for joining the public dairy cooperative network I forgotten the name of Jarrena but in that area there's an entity called Sudha in Bihar at least. So Jarken may there is another one but but so we onboarded them into that. The initial was to set up the self-help groups, organizing them, finding women. It was entire northern jhark and parma hazar bag that part we covered. Southern jhark was another team and uh us out of these 300 tribal women we chose 12 uh self-help groups. Each group would be having around let's say around 8 to 10 people or sometimes 12 people as well.
 
 
01:26:46
 
Mentee's Presentation: So and then providing them with training connecting them with the right stakeholders IAP Indian council for agriculture research provided a lot of support were providing a lot of supporting support and helping them scale and become viable businesses. So we did that.
Mentor : Got it. Got it. And who sponsored this? Uh I mean it's it's a program of u some multilateral agencies, is it?
Mentee's Presentation: It was a mix of program for multilateral agency. So the program was already going on for quite some time. Jan Sea Parish has been doing some form of other. They used to do organic agriculture and other things that donors had. this case IFAD which is an international fund for agricultural development uh gave us the sort of the base funding for this. So IFAD and UN UN they work quite a bit. So iPad was the main agency. Yeah.
Mentor : Good. So first point is design and let the program for creation of.
 
 
01:27:48
 
Mentor : So your program was itself was that you create SSGS
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So completely the SGS were not there. So we recruited them essentially but of course if you're operating because this comp this JSP has been working there for over 40 years 50 years now. So they knew the area they have been doing quite a good lot of work in Baliva and all that stakeholders. So we just had to go and help them organize into self groups basic if you remember. It was a very big thing that was going on. So we used to provide that end to end service. So it was a package we designed
Mentor : And any
Mentee's Presentation: right
Mentor : specific type of uh vocation or business
Mentee's Presentation: ag
Mentor : these
Mentee's Presentation: uh yeah
Mentor : to do
Mentee's Presentation: yeah yeah u dairy farming animal husband that's why I brought up the rashri goal mission so self-help group organized they were given basic training in terms of organic agriculture basic of let's say beads based manufacturing you're doing paper manufacturing was also something handmade paper was something we tied up with another NGO that was doing it but the microenterprises we focused on which was basically the crux of the work was this 12 uh SGS that we chose
 
 
01:29:10
 
Mentee's Presentation: out of this 300 tries we had recruited uh which were to be integrated into the public dairy cooperative network whatever uh cattle they got uh buffalo
Mentor : And
Mentee's Presentation: they
Mentor : what
Mentee's Presentation: got
Mentor : happened to this other 288? Uh, sorry. Huh? 288 me.
Mentee's Presentation: uh yeah yeah I think around you can say 150 160 170 people
Mentor : Huh?
Mentee's Presentation: by and large I think we we left it be they were given the mentoring and training and all. So sometimes we were also helping some of them for organic agriculture. FPO was not a big thing then but we were trying to sort of organize these women into some sort of collective for doing organic farming but it I would say it didn't take off to that extent. So we sort of pivoted
Mentor : incubate. What? How did you incubate this?
Mentee's Presentation: the 12 plus microenterprises.
Mentor : Huh?
Mentee's Presentation: there was this whole package we designed.
 
 
01:30:05
 
Mentee's Presentation: So first was providing them with training. Uh so connecting them with SAU state agricultural university was there. There was we got a lot of support from PUSA which is an institute for agriculture research. Indian council of agriculture research also provided us with support.
Mentor : Before
Mentee's Presentation: So we connected them with the experts for mentoring because the initial SG part was we already mentored them internal regulation governance.
Mentor : that my question was different. My question is how did you identify the
Mentee's Presentation: Oh
Mentor : people
Mentee's Presentation: yeah. Yeah. So the 12 plus people we identified we had our own metric agriculture just say if you have already have cattle and you have experience because owning a cattle as a person versus owning a cattle 10 people owning it is a very complex thing which I have also seen when you're doing a project with five other people. So it's not easy to do that right. So go be use that at least if
 
 
01:30:58
 
Mentor : Sure.
Mentee's Presentation: you have worked in someone's house. So most of the cases I think I think 80% of cases with people did not own cattle but they had worked at someone's house and just how do you milk cattle you need to know okay there are different types of cattle and all so that was the metric primary metric but there are other list as well I don't think that will be difficult for me to find out I can find that
Mentor : Sure. Okay. So Pal designed and led the program for creation of a network of SSGS. Uh over 300 tribes women uh you should write that it was a IED and UN
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : funed project or something like that. Okay.
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : What was the context was missing is missing here?
Mentee's Presentation: All right.
Mentor : Semicolon just put semicolon or in continuous over 300 tribes women for uh uh for a for a IFED and UN funded
Mentee's Presentation: Right,
Mentor : uh initiative or project or whatever you call it.
 
 
01:31:59
 
Mentor : Okay, that is one part inclusion project whatever you call it right what is the objective of this project right and who invested on it or who supported this okay so just
Mentee's Presentation: right,
Mentor : give that context to this particular line by writing by adding that in the last okay
Mentee's Presentation: right,
Mentor : uh clear this point clear
Mentee's Presentation: right, right,
Mentor : yeah
Mentee's Presentation: right, right,
Mentor : uh another point is second point
Mentee's Presentation: right.
Mentor : You start with saying successfully incubated 12 plus
Mentee's Presentation: hang.
Mentor : sustainable and microenterprises
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : in dairy farming sector. Then you don't have to write in line with program objectives that is okay. then semicolon and then all these things provided program programmatic uh programmatic consulting for so these are for these 12 people only right this SG SS
Mentee's Presentation: Right, right, right. Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : for SSG provided programmatic programmatic consulting covering yeah all these things so you're starting with that incubated 12 these guys and I have provided the this thing to them okay that is the second point
 
 
01:33:18
 
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : How do you measure that these guys are doing good or bad?
Mentee's Presentation: So this was actually this was a more easy task because we had been given metric itself government state government metric a loan repayment there is it was a collateral free loan essentially under government. So at the same time we used to track very closely how is the health of all the cattle that was provided because in that area foot and mouth disease and there are a lot of other health issues that you can see with cattle. So cattle health was one more thing. Dairy production itself was something that was key you can track it almost on a daily basis and because SSGS had been taught how to note it while noting so we could track it production they delivering to the uh the daily cooperative. So that three four you can say blend of cattle health
Mentor : So
Mentee's Presentation: financial liability
Mentor : my
Mentee's Presentation: and
Mentor : question
Mentee's Presentation: so on.
 
 
01:34:08
 
Mentor : is that only let's say after you selecting 12 people 12 SSDs and giving all this training did you measure that were they successful were they improve
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : huh so
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : write that right write that
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : that
Mentee's Presentation: Okay.
Mentor : uh saw whatever performance improvement by XYZ% Maybe you can say operational, financial performance or whatever performance you match at a at a broader level.
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : Yeah. Uh that let's say one is operational, one could be financial
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm.
Mentor : by overall this much percentage over the year of 3 years or two years. Okay. So that will kind of kind of validate what you are saying what you are saying in the second point,
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : right?
Mentee's Presentation: How should I frame this? Uh just say how should I start this point?
Mentor : You say improved uh saw or track uh monitored I mean ah something like that monitored the performance of u uh sages semicolon um uh insured or so basically now you're saying key even after I'm monitoring and in between I'm supporting them right
 
 
01:35:30
 
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : monitored and helped SSGS to achieve a operational and production or whatever financial performance improvement by X% in two years
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : or operational could be X% and financial could be 5%.
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : So what I'm trying to say I did it's like a story
Mentee's Presentation: Mhm. Perfect. Yeah. Right.
Mentor : you're telling to someone
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah. Yeah.
Mentor : right? So everything is linked actually if you see first point, second point, third point it is linked. Okay. And then this is good. This is stakeholder management orchestrated multi- stakeholder partnership with state government financial citizen policy but
Mentee's Presentation: Yeah.
Mentor : this activity has a value and
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : somewhere it is a support for all your result which you have on
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
Mentor : the
Mentee's Presentation: Right.
