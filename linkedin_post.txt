Here's a refined version of your LinkedIn post:

"I'll never forget my first product leadership meeting, where I felt like an imposter. With a software development background and no business or strategy experience, I was thrilled to land the job of a lifetime - leading the product vision for a high-growth startup. But as I dived into projects and worked with our engineering team, I realized I lacked one crucial thing: business acumen.

I felt lost when it came to understanding customer insights, analyzing data to inform product decisions, or considering financial implications. It was like being an engineer who didn't know how to fix a broken engine - all my technical expertise meant nothing without a solid foundation in business.

So, I made the scary decision to commit to learning. I took online courses, worked on live projects, and even enrolled in electives at my university. My goal was to become proficient in analytics, corporate finance, and strategy by the end of the year.

It wasn't easy. There were countless nights spent studying, pouring over financial reports, or trying to make sense of complex data sets. But with each passing week, I felt myself becoming more confident.

I devoured books like "Case in Point" and sought out mentors who could guide me on my journey. And slowly but surely, the pieces started to fall into place. I began to see patterns in our customer behavior that told a different story from what we were seeing in our data. I started making recommendations for features that weren't just technically feasible, but also financially sound.

A year into this commitment, I've seen my career prospects soar and become a more informed, strategic product leader. Looking back, I'm reminded of the importance of acknowledging your weaknesses and taking proactive steps to bridge them.

What skills do you think are most critical for product leaders to master - and how did you bridge your own gaps?"
